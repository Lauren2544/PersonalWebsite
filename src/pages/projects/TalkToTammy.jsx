        Welcome to Talk To Tammy!
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Talk to Tammy is your own quarantine buddy who is a discord chat bot built in python with games, translations, access to the internet, and voice-enabled Q&A. 
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Talk to Tammy was built with nlp before ChatGPT and llms were as wide spread as they currently are. Talk to Tammy was built at MLH Same Home Different Hacks by Lauren Rowe, Rohan Singh, Chris King, and Daniel Qiu. Talk to Tammy is unfortunately disabled and no longer running as we ran out of free google cloud credits, and well unfortunately or fortunately ... chatGPT is a much much much better version of Talk to Tammy, but at our projects height our chat bot was installed on 50+ servers. 
      </p>
