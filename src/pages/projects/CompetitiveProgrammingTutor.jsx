        Welcome to your Competitive Programming Tutor!
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        The Competitive Programming Tutor was built in html and css to help teach you the basics of competitive programming. This website can be used as a solution manual to use while studing for the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) - a competition run by the University of Waterloo with the goal of teaching high school students how to code!
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        I was just learning C while making this website so the C solutions are not entirely complete. But for the problems I did solve in both C and Python, it was fun to see how much faster the C versions ran!
      </p>

      {/* How It Works */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-colour1 mt-10 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>Navigate to the problem section you want (J1 is easiest, S3 is hardest).</li>
        <li>Read the problem and try to solve!</li>
        <li>If you get stuck check the "click here for more information" for hints.</li>
        <li>Finally take a look at the solution.</li>
      </ol>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>C is so so so much faster than python.</li>
        <li>Creating a website aimed at teaching others also helped me learn.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>There are only limited problems solved in C.</li>
